# Does anybody even read these?

I started keeping a log of my unusual sleep hours, and realized that text wouldn't cut it, so I wrote some visualization for it. You can run it the usual way, with `npm start`.

The input it expects is any number of lines in the format `02:00-06:00, 08:00-10:00` and so on.
