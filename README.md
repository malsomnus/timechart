I started keeping a log of my unusual sleep hours, and realized that text wouldn't cut it, so I wrote some visualization for it. You can run it the usual way, with `npm start`.

The input it expects is any number of lines in the format `02:00-06:00, 08:00-10:00` and so on. 

If you're a potential employer looking for code samples, App.js and App.scss are the interesting parts.
